Pretty quiet, is the voice of reason for Revel. Keeps everyone in line and is more of an authorative type. He's a bit shy, but knows when to take initiative, and can be coaxed into talking more. He tolerates Revel, but in the end they make good owners for the second chance bakery. He's a demon as well, no clue what he did or what kind of demon he is yet, but he has fire abilities, or at least he can heat things up with his hands. He uses this to aid him in sugar sculpting.

He has a libido that could probably match Revels, but he keeps it under control and to himself for the most part. The heat he emits from his touch can be used for pleasure enhancement too. He's very patient and caring with Everestm being rather fond of her bubbly and outgoing personality when she's in a good mood.


Cain is the co-owner of my second chance bakery, Sinfully Marvelous, which is owned by Revel. Cain is the level headded, voice-of-reason one compared to Revel's outlandish womanizing ways, and possibly helps keep the business afloat. He seems a bit introverted, but he knows when to take initiative and kick on the authority switch. Though he's usually quiet, if he's asked the right kinds of questions you can get him talking up a storm. Along with Revel, he's also a demon, another fire based one just like Torch. He's able to control his fire abilities though, and mostly uses them to warm his hands while making sugar sculptures. Also known to use a warming sensation during sexual play.

Both him and Revel were given second chances, though I'm unsure of what they did before. Regardless, they now run a bakery that gives people a second chance at employment. Felons, previous drug addicts, those who just cannot get a job cause they lack experience, that's what they help with. Of course they can't help everyone, they don't want people bringing in drugs or getting murdered, and theft will still get you fired. But they do provide housing listings for those who need cheap apartments, and most of the employees are only temporary. The bakery is meant to be a halfway point to get into a better job, learn some skills to better fit into the industry, or find their true calling. 

I was floored when one day I found a news article of a restaurant doing this exact thing, especially since I wanna expand the bakery into a restaurant of sorts <3 Made me really happy that it's a plan that actually works in the real world
